# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## What this is

An **Internal-Tools Starter** — a Turborepo monorepo template for internal
tools and small dashboards. Two Next.js 16 apps (`@repo/web` public app on
:3000, `@repo/admin` dashboard on :3001) sit on top of shared packages under
`packages/*`. The example domain is a generic `Item` resource; replace it with
your real model(s).

The package scope is `@repo/*`. When starting a real project, run the rename
flow to swap it for your own scope (see [`docs/00-starter-guide.md`](./docs/00-starter-guide.md)).

Full prose docs live in [`docs/`](./docs/). When working on a specific area,
read the matching doc — they go deeper than this file.

## Commands

Run from the repo root. Turborepo handles cross-package ordering.

```bash
pnpm dev              # both apps in parallel
pnpm dev:web          # public app only
pnpm dev:admin        # admin dashboard only

pnpm build            # all packages + apps (topological)
pnpm typecheck        # tsc --noEmit across the workspace
pnpm test             # Vitest unit tests
pnpm lint             # oxlint  (NOT eslint)
pnpm format           # oxfmt   (NOT prettier)
pnpm lint:fix
pnpm format:fix

pnpm db:generate      # prisma generate
pnpm db:migrate:dev   # prisma migrate dev (author new migration in dev)
pnpm db:migrate       # prisma migrate deploy (prod)
pnpm db:seed          # idempotent — re-runnable
pnpm db:studio
pnpm auth:gen-schema  # regenerate auth schema after plugin changes

# Stage-scoped DB tooling (reads root .env.staging / .env.production):
pnpm db:migrate:staging
pnpm db:migrate:prod
pnpm db:seed:staging     # sets SEED_ALLOW_REMOTE=true — no db:seed:prod (dangerous by design)
pnpm db:studio:staging
pnpm db:studio:prod
pnpm db:reset            # prisma migrate reset (local)
pnpm db:reset:staging

# Local Postgres via Docker:
docker compose up -d db

# Single-workspace operations:
pnpm --filter @repo/web add some-package
pnpm --filter @repo/db studio
pnpm turbo run build --filter=@repo/web    # one app + its deps
```

Node ≥ 24, pnpm 9.15. Roles are `admin | editor | viewer` (capability map in
`@repo/auth`; `defaultRole` is still `admin` so a fresh clone bootstraps with
zero setup). Unit tests run on Vitest (`pnpm test`); e2e on Playwright (specs in
`e2e/`).

## Architecture essentials

**Dependency direction** is strict: `apps/*` → `packages/*`, never the reverse.
Within packages, the rough order is `tsconfig` / `env` → `types` → `db` →
`auth`; `ui`, `storage`, and `logger` are leaves. No circular deps.

**Internal packages have no build step.** They're consumed as TypeScript source
via Next.js `transpilePackages` in each app's `next.config.ts`. Edits in
`packages/*` show up in apps without rebuilding. If you add a new package,
register it in the consuming app's `transpilePackages` array.

**The public web app works without `DATABASE_URL`.** `apps/web/lib/db.ts` falls
back to `@repo/db/seed-data` (the example dataset). This is intentional — a
fresh clone must boot with zero setup. Don't replace the fallback with ad-hoc
mock data; use `@repo/db/seed-data`.

**Example domain model.** One generic resource, `Item` (`title`, `description`,
`status` enum `draft|active|archived`, optional `owner` relation, soft-delete
via `deletedAt`). The admin app has one CRUD resource (`/items`) plus user
management (`/users`) and profile (`/profile`). Better Auth tables
(user/session/account/verification) are kept verbatim — they're the contract
Better Auth's Prisma adapter expects.

**Auth model** — Better Auth 1.4 with the `admin` plugin. Roles are
`admin | editor | viewer` (`defaultRole: "admin"` so a fresh clone bootstraps
with zero setup; real projects should lower it). DB-backed sessions (instant
revoke, no JWT staleness), email/password + optional Google OAuth, Prisma
adapter.

- **RBAC** — a capability map (`Capability`, `ROLE_CAPABILITIES`) lives in
  `packages/auth/src/permissions.ts`, mirrored on the Better Auth side by an
  access-control config in `packages/auth/src/access-control.ts`. Roles are also
  a Zod enum in `@repo/types` (`appRoleSchema` + `ROLE_LABELS` /
  `ROLE_DESCRIPTIONS`). Keep enum + permission map + access-control in lockstep.
- `proxy.ts` (replaces `middleware.ts` post-CVE-2025-29927) is **optimistic,
  cookie-only** in the admin app — never the sole gate. The web app's `proxy.ts`
  does per-IP rate limiting, not auth.
- `requireAdmin()` from `@repo/auth/next`, called in Server Components / route
  handlers / Server Actions, is the source of truth. It redirects to `/sign-in`
  (no session) or `/forbidden` (not admin / banned). `requireRole(...roles)` and
  `requireCapability(capability)` are the non-admin gates with the same redirect
  conventions.
- Only the admin app mounts `/api/auth/[...all]`.

**Database** — plain Postgres via Prisma 7 + `@prisma/adapter-pg` (node-postgres).
Works with local Docker, Neon, Supabase, RDS, Railway. For spatial work, the
`feat/geo` branch re-introduces PostGIS + a map; cherry-pick it when needed.
For raw SQL, use `prisma.$queryRaw<Row[]>\`...\``with a typed row generic;
tagged template literals parameterize safely. Don't reach for`any`.

**State** — Server Components for data, **URL search params for filters/sort/
selection** (the `Item` filters are `ItemFilters` in `@repo/types`), `useState`
for local UI only. No Redux / Zustand / React Query. When adding a new filter,
update the relevant schema in `@repo/types` and the query builder in
`packages/db/src/queries/`.

**Env** — read via the per-concern modules under `@repo/env/*`:
`@repo/env/db`, `@repo/env/auth`, `@repo/env/client` (the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` one,
including `APP_ENV`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` — the deployment marker that drives a
non-production banner; unset = production), `@repo/env/features` (server-only
feature flags, off by default — `getFeatureFlags()` reads them, and
`requireFeature(flag)` from `apps/admin/lib/require-feature.ts` gates a route,
redirecting to `/forbidden` like the other gates), `@repo/env/storage`,
`@repo/env/revalidate`. Never `process.env.X` directly in app code (the one
sanctioned exception is `@repo/logger`, which reads `LOG_LEVEL`/`NODE_ENV`
before any env module is loaded). Adding an env var — including a feature
flag — requires updating: the `.env.example` files, `turbo.json`'s `build.env`
array, and the matching Zod schema in `packages/env/src/`.

**Env files are centralized at the repo root.** Root `.env.local` is shared by
both apps and the Prisma CLI tooling. Each app's `dev` script loads
`apps/<app>/.env.local` FIRST (per-app overrides win on duplicate keys) then
root `.env.local` (shared vars fill in the rest) via `dotenv-cli` — a missing
file is not an error, so a fresh clone with no env files still boots. Per-app
`.env.example` files are slim: only the overrides that must differ per app
(e.g. admin's `BETTER_AUTH_URL`). `.env.staging` / `.env.production` at the
root are gitignored, per-stage files that back the `db:*:staging` / `db:*:prod`
commands.

**Display name** — read from `@repo/env/client`'s `APP_NAME`
(`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`, default "Internal Tools"). Never hardcode the product
name in UI.

**Catalog versions** — framework/tooling versions are pinned in
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `catalog:` block. Bump there once; every workspace picks
it up. Don't pin Next/React/Tailwind versions in individual `package.json`
files — reference `"catalog:"`.

## Conventions worth knowing

- **No `any`.** Declare row types for `$queryRaw`; write explicit shapes.
- **No ad-hoc mock data in components** — fall back to `@repo/db/seed-data`.
- **No hard-coded colors/fonts** — use design tokens from `@repo/ui` (Tailwind 4
  `@theme inline`, oklch palette). Status tone tokens are semantic:
  `--status-success`, `--status-warning`, `--status-muted` (each with a `-soft`
  background variant). When generating shadcn components, rewrite literal colors
  to tokens (e.g. `bg-primary`, not `bg-amber-500`) before merging.
- **Shadcn used in both apps** lives in `packages/ui/src/components/` with an
  `exports` entry in `packages/ui/package.json`.
- **Server-side data fetching by default.** Drop to `"use client"` only when
  needed for interactivity.
- **Mutations are Server Actions** (`_actions.ts` colocated with the route),
  guarded by `requireAdmin()`. They invalidate cache tags via `updateTag(...)`.
- **No barrel files inside packages** — they hurt tree-shaking.
- **Avoid abbreviations** in public APIs (`organization`, not `org`).

## Commit conventions

`feat: | fix: | refactor: | chore: | docs: | style: | test:`. Enforced by
commitlint on `commit-msg`. Branches `feat/short-description`. Squash on merge.
